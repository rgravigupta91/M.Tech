Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation.

The place has great trip advisor reviews so we had high expectations that were sadly not met.  What really ruined our nice meal was the self service. A waiter gave us (a party of 5) two tablets to look at the menu on. Unlike with proper menus, where everyone can browse at their own speed we had to share a tablet between 5. We asked the waiter for more tablets and were given one. After we had eventually all used the tablets to browse and input our orders on to one tablet the tablet then had an error message and froze. We used the other tablet to order and that one ran out of battery. We were hungry after a long day travelling this was stressful. Eventually one of the waiters came over and took details of our order. I really disliked this way of ordering food, and would not use the restaurant again because of this.  The table was also dirty, there was dust and bits of fluff on the table and cloth napkins and my aunt was given a chipped glass which she discovered upon taking a drink. We told the waiter and he apologised and got us a new glass but again, this just really made our experience a disappointment.  Very disappointed as seems to have good reviews, maybe we came on a bad day but we didn't like the menu/way of ordering, the table was dirty and a member of our party was given a chipped glass.\",\n          \"SERVICE HORRENDOUS!!!!! Listen to the reviews. Sandwich was decent enough (maybe because I was soooo hungry after a hectic day out) well presented but the service put me off completely. 12 servers on the floor including the manager and not one person came over to check back to make sure all was okay with our meals. All hanging around talking. And when I say 12 that\\u2019s not even an exaggeration. Not a 5 star service. And certainly not a 5 star hotel. We did ask for bottled water and when poured in to a glass you could see tiny bubbles forming and microscopic imperfections on the glass because it was so warm. I asked for cold water and I was told they did not have any? I explained that I will not be drinking the warm water after waiting 15 minutes a new bottle came out...coldish.. 5 star ? And they do not have cold water! Ridiculous. Maybe for further tourist this could be a preference, cold water or temperature. 3700 rupees \\u20ac46 for two sandwiches, bottled water and terrible service! Certainly not worth it.

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too.

The place has great trip advisor reviews so we had high expectations that were sadly not met.  What really ruined our nice meal was the self service. A waiter gave us (a party of 5) two tablets to look at the menu on. Unlike with proper menus, where everyone can browse at their own speed we had to share a tablet between 5. We asked the waiter for more tablets and were given one. After we had eventually all used the tablets to browse and input our orders on to one tablet the tablet then had an error message and froze. We used the other tablet to order and that one ran out of battery. We were hungry after a long day travelling this was stressful. Eventually one of the waiters came over and took details of our order. I really disliked this way of ordering food, and would not use the restaurant again because of this.  The table was also dirty, there was dust and bits of fluff on the table and cloth napkins and my aunt was given a chipped glass which she discovered upon taking a drink. We told the waiter and he apologised and got us a new glass but again, this just really made our experience a disappointment.  Very disappointed as seems to have good reviews, maybe we came on a bad day but we didn't like the menu/way of ordering, the table was dirty and a member of our party was given a chipped glass.\",\n          \"SERVICE HORRENDOUS!!!!! Listen to the reviews. Sandwich was decent enough (maybe because I was soooo hungry after a hectic day out) well presented but the service put me off completely. 12 servers on the floor including the manager and not one person came over to check back to make sure all was okay with our meals. All hanging around talking. And when I say 12 that\\u2019s not even an exaggeration. Not a 5 star service. And certainly not a 5 star hotel. We did ask for bottled water and when poured in to a glass you could see tiny bubbles forming and microscopic imperfections on the glass because it was so warm. I asked for cold water and I was told they did not have any? I explained that I will not be drinking the warm water after waiting 15 minutes a new bottle came out...coldish.. 5 star ? And they do not have cold water! Ridiculous. Maybe for further tourist this could be a preference, cold water or temperature. 3700 rupees \\u20ac46 for two sandwiches, bottled water and terrible service! Certainly not worth it. I reckon the street food stalls would give a better service then here \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":35}],"id":"2mgE55M2ajgL"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too. If you're looking for a classy yet soothing Italian place in Delhi,Fatjar is a go to for you!\",\n          \"Whilst staying at the Welcolmhotel Dwarka we visited Pavillion 75 expecting great things but we were disappointed. The place has great trip advisor reviews so we had high expectations that were sadly not met.  What really ruined our nice meal was the self service. A waiter gave us (a party of 5) two tablets to look at the menu on. Unlike with proper menus, where everyone can browse at their own speed we had to share a tablet between 5. We asked the waiter for more tablets and were given one. After we had eventually all used the tablets to browse and input our orders on to one tablet the tablet then had an error message and froze. We used the other tablet to order and that one ran out of battery. We were hungry after a long day travelling this was stressful. Eventually one of the waiters came over and took details of our order. I really disliked this way of ordering food, and would not use the restaurant again because of this.  The table was also dirty, there was dust and bits of fluff on the table and cloth napkins and my aunt was given a chipped glass which she discovered upon taking a drink. We told the waiter and he apologised and got us a new glass but again, this just really made our experience a disappointment.  Very disappointed as seems to have good reviews, maybe we came on a bad day but we didn't like the menu/way of ordering, the table was dirty and a member of our party was given a chipped glass.\",\n          \"SERVICE HORRENDOUS!!!!! Listen to the reviews. Sandwich was decent enough (maybe because I was soooo hungry after a hectic day out) well presented but the service put me off completely. 12 servers on the floor including the manager and not one person came over to check back to make sure all was okay with our meals. All hanging around talking. And when I say 12 that\\u2019s not even an exaggeration. Not a 5 star service. And certainly not a 5 star hotel. We did ask for bottled water and when poured in to a glass you could see tiny bubbles forming and microscopic imperfections on the glass because it was so warm. I asked for cold water and I was told they did not have any? I explained that I will not be drinking the warm water after waiting 15 minutes a new bottle came out...coldish.. 5 star ? And they do not have cold water! Ridiculous. Maybe for further tourist this could be a preference, cold water or temperature. 3700 rupees \\u20ac46 for two sandwiches, bottled water and terrible service! Certainly not worth it. I reckon the street food stalls would give a better service then here \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"Overall\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Food Quality\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Service\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Ambience\\\": \\\"Positive\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"Overall\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Food Quality\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Service\\\": \\\"Not Applicable\\\",\\\"Ambience\\\": \\\"Positive\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"Overall\\\": \\\"Positive\\\",\\\"Food Quality\\\": \\\"Neutral\\\",\\\"Service\\\": \\\"Negative\\\",\\\"Ambience\\\": \\\"Not Applicable\\\"}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_response_parsed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Food Quality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Service\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Ambience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":130}],"id":"5fudlsBnbHTj"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_data_3 = data_with_parsed_model_output_3.drop(['model_response','model_response_parsed'], axis=1)\n","final_data_3.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":310},"outputId":"266a3086-1a7a-41a0-cbe7-bf726774a3bf","id":"v6Ktnid1bHTk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  restaurant_ID  rating_review  \\\n","0        FLV202              5   \n","1        SAV303              5   \n","2        YUM789              5   \n","3        TST101              5   \n","4        EAT456              5   \n","\n","                                         review_full   Overall  \\\n","0  Totally in love with the Auro of the place, re...  positive   \n","1  Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes no...  positive   \n","2  Excellent taste and awesome decorum.

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too.

The place has great trip advisor reviews so we had high expectations that were sadly not met.  What really ruined our nice meal was the self service. A waiter gave us (a party of 5) two tablets to look at the menu on. Unlike with proper menus, where everyone can browse at their own speed we had to share a tablet between 5. We asked the waiter for more tablets and were given one. After we had eventually all used the tablets to browse and input our orders on to one tablet the tablet then had an error message and froze. We used the other tablet to order and that one ran out of battery. We were hungry after a long day travelling this was stressful. Eventually one of the waiters came over and took details of our order. I really disliked this way of ordering food, and would not use the restaurant again because of this.  The table was also dirty, there was dust and bits of fluff on the table and cloth napkins and my aunt was given a chipped glass which she discovered upon taking a drink. We told the waiter and he apologised and got us a new glass but again, this just really made our experience a disappointment.  Very disappointed as seems to have good reviews, maybe we came on a bad day but we didn't like the menu/way of ordering, the table was dirty and a member of our party was given a chipped glass.\",\n          \"SERVICE HORRENDOUS!!!!! Listen to the reviews. Sandwich was decent enough (maybe because I was soooo hungry after a hectic day out) well presented but the service put me off completely. 12 servers on the floor including the manager and not one person came over to check back to make sure all was okay with our meals. All hanging around talking. And when I say 12 that\\u2019s not even an exaggeration. Not a 5 star service. And certainly not a 5 star hotel. We did ask for bottled water and when poured in to a glass you could see tiny bubbles forming and microscopic imperfections on the glass because it was so warm. I asked for cold water and I was told they did not have any? I explained that I will not be drinking the warm water after waiting 15 minutes a new bottle came out...coldish.. 5 star ? And they do not have cold water! Ridiculous. Maybe for further tourist this could be a preference, cold water or temperature. 3700 rupees \\u20ac46 for two sandwiches, bottled water and terrible service! Certainly not worth it. I reckon the street food stalls would give a better service then here \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Food Quality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Service\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Ambience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not applicable\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":131}],"id":"v6Ktnid1bHTk"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_data_3['Overall'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"ede1974a-cc05-493b-b15d-c4b91e567e9c","id":"8dm8LimPbHTl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Overall\n","positive    10\n","negative     7\n","neutral      3\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":132}],"id":"8dm8LimPbHTl"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_data_3['Food Quality'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"486fd5c9-8efa-4639-bc84-a46ab69cd85c","id":"79rgJ_pObHTm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Food Quality\n","positive              6\n","neutral               6\n","not applicable        4\n","negative              3\n","if not exceptional    1\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":133}],"id":"79rgJ_pObHTm"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Note:** One of the sentiment is 'if not exceptional'.
