0,3306,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",3

2,17227,I would like to tell this company that the whole box of bars had melted and then it was so crumbly to eat it was a mess I don't want to spend the money to send them back it's so expensive but wish they would send me another box that was not melted and falling apart. What do you do about that?,1
3,18152,"The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again).",2

10,37870,"I love this tea. The Good Earth tea bags result in a slightly tangy, sweet tea without needing to use sugar. I will frequently have several cups of this tea in the winter and in the summer it makes a good iced tea. I have several friends who have diabetes and they have all really liked it when I serve it. Unlike a lot of other herbal teas, this tea is based on spices rather than on rose hips which tend to upset my stomach. I highly reccommend this tea to anyone that likes herbal teas and likes to watch their sugar intake. The caffinated Good Earth original tea is also very good, giving you a caffine hit and a slightly sweetened tea without using sugar. Both teas have a very pleasant taste without being overwhelming. The Good Earth original tea reminds me a bit of the really great Seattle Spice Market tea.",5
11,39892,"Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract.  While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims, they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast.  They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe, however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process, but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections, I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection.",1
12,40771,"I have a lab that absolutely loves these.  I buy the 6-pack of small dog peanut butter since they're small enough to fit in a Kong and fill it up.  She loves them so much in fact that she'll bring the Kong over to me, drop it and stare at me until I pick it up and say the catch phrase; ""Want me to fill it?"".  Once I say that, she bolts to the kitchen where I keep them and paces or sits in place until she gets it.  It's almost impossible to find a good grain-free peanut butter treat and these do have barley flour as the main ingredient, which isn't bad by any stretch, but they are meant as treats and not as a primary food source, so I don't want to get too crazy about her carbohydrate intake.  A dogs digestive tract processes fats and proteins first and since carbs are generally non-essential in the process and either get converted to glucose for energy or become part of the waste, they're not really needed that much.  Plus, the tumeric and rosemary seem to make her farts much more bearable.  :)",5
13,42582,"My dogs loved the taste of these treats but they were much to small to provide them with any amount of chew time.  I have two dogs 21 and 23 pounds and they had these chewed up in less then a minute, so I don't think that it served as a benefit for their oral health.  I do not feel that the price of the larger chews, for the number you get in a package would be worth the value.",3

16,55543,"This product was not bad, but was disappointing.  The box promises ""roasted nut and honey.""  While I could detect the ""honey"" flavor, rendered as a glaze more reminiscent of sugar than honey, there is little to no nut flavor.  In deed the product image shows each ""O"" covered in nuts and promises, ""nuts in every bite,"" the actual appearance is much different with no visible nuts on the cereal.<br /><br />The texture is fine.  The crunch holds up in milk.  It is more of an airy texture than say a dense Cheerio.  More the texture of Honeycomb brand cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally this product is mediocre.  Again not bad, but could be better.  Sugars rack in at 10g, less than many sugar sweetened cereal but still high.  Fiber is 2g which is something, but a bit low.  1g of fat is gaood and none of it saturated or trans fat.<br /><br />I will finish the box, but will not by more of these again.",2

23,89573,"I wish the ingredients were a little healthier because my two mini dachshunds really love this food. I should have read the ingredients first. The soy ingredients don't bother me as much as the food coloring does. (Added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color).  The green peas and vegetables in the mix aren't really veggies, but a kibble formed into vegetable shapes and colored to look like vegetables. I wish pet food manufacturers would spend less on making dog food look appetizing to humans and more in making it healthy for our pets.<br /><br />Although beef is the first ingredient on the list, most of the rest are grain products including soy, corn and rice. One of our dogs sometimes has a sensitive stomach and it's probably all the soy that doesn't always agree. Another ingredient is animal digest which could contain goodness knows what. I think I prefer the limited ingredient types of foods that my dogs normally eat, ones where I can recognize all the ingredients and they don't sound like something I wouldn't want to eat.",3

I own two French presses, an Aeropress, several drip machines, and a moka pot.  All are great but I love the ease of using my Keurig. After purchasing it last year I have probably tried 20 or 25 different k-cups.  For a while I really liked the Donut Shop by Coffee People.  But I grew tired of it.  It's great when it's hot but not so much when it cools off a bit.  Some of the other full bodied cups tend to be very bitter.  The Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, Newman's Extra Bold, etc. all can be good but not great.  I had pretty much decided that given the convenience of the Keurig machine I would have to sacrifice a bit on taste.  Then I stumbled on Diedrich's Sumatra and I'm hooked.  This is the one you want to buy in bulk and keep in the pantry.  It's a very good Sumatra blend that is great hot or even just slightly warm.  It's never bitter and very smooth.  It has that classic chocolate Sumatra flavor.  For me this is the only k-cup I've found to be consistent time after time.  I'm on my fourth box already.",5

I loved the fact that these are single serve packs, keeping them fresh, and couldn't wait for them to arrive. I was excited when then arrived...that is until I actually tried them.  AWFUL is the only word I know to describe them. These have absolutely no flavor, few chips, and the chips that they do have don't even taste like a chocolate chip...maybe the really cheap imitation chocolate chips you sometimes see at the dollar type stores. If I was to put flour in a bowl, add a little sugar, and a few imitation chocolate bits, it would probably taste something similar to these cookies. I usually don't mind the bargain cookies in the stores, but these Nabisco cookies are so tasteless and bad that I did not even finish the first cookie out of the single serving pack. Cancelled my subscription and will be throwing the rest away...not even worth donating to someplace. My advice, save yourself a few dollars and do not buy these.

Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.

But they have one purpose in their un-glamorous existence, and that purpose is to stay together when dunked in very hot tea (with milk, of course) and to taste thoroughly delicious when devoured in that wobbly, floppy, milky-tea-sodden state. Basically, when you need a Rich Tea, you need a Rich Tea, and there is no other biscuit (that's ""cookie"" to most of you, I suppose) that will suffice. And when you need a Rich Tea, if it's not made by McVitie's, you really might as well forget about it.

143,452508,"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",1
144,452599,I bought this because I was looking for something with probiotics.  I have purchased a similar product from Plum Organics (contained Pro and prebiotics).  I have purchased several items from HappyBellies before and have been pleased with them all.  I ordered this despite the reviews from others that commented on the rancid smell.  I assume this has to do with the added DHA.  I bought 6 containers.  Opened all 6 and they ALL smelled rancid.  I would never feed this to my child.  Ended up contacting Amazon because there was no return available for this product.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy Plum Organics Multi grain cereal.,1
145,457730,"These are large cans of beans, not dry beans like I thought.  I would have kept them because Eden Foods is one of the few producers of canned goods that do not include BPA in their linings (I'm a big fan of Eden).  Some of the cans, however, arrived damaged at the seams which can let in air and cause bacterial growth.  They were packaged poorly, having put the cans with several books making the somewhat small box weigh 30 lbs and destined to be damaged.<br /><br />Update:  I wrote ""canned, not dry"" because originally there was not a photo.  I'm glad Amazon is listening!",1
146,465616,"I'm a huge fan of the Village Mixes products. I'm pretty picky about what I serve my family, especially when it comes to packaged food, but these products meet my expectations for quality. No nasty additives or preservatives, or stuff I can't pronounce! My kids love the Apple Crisp. My son even requested it instead of a birthday cake one year! Really easy to make, too. I've even given these to teachers, bus drivers, etc. as gifts - the boxes are really pretty.",5
147,470480,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.",5
148,472361,"I wanted to like it, since it is so much healthier than most alternatives. But the taste just isn't there. My daughter and I both immediately said the same thing after tasting it. While it is indeed spicy (i.e., hot), it is also sweet, which sort of deadens the spiciness of the flavor. We wish that we hadn't ordered two boxes of this, but had tried a different flavor instead. Perhaps we will. But it is somewhat disconcerting to consider that we might also not like the taste of the different flavor, since the cost of the product is not inexpensive. Thus we are not yet sure that we will order more.",2
149,473708,"As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried, stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.",3

You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!",5

Serve them with grated parmesan or imitation parmesan, tomato sauce, olive oil, a little garlic, and you have a delicious meal.  It's a godsend for people who must watch their calories carefully and still crave to eat foods beyond vegetables.  As someone who has always had to watch her weight, I strongly recommend that you give them a chance.  And the fact that it's good for your health is another plus.  Try Whole Foods or Wild By Nature.

156,483808,"It's not bad. My son is picky and didn't like the fruity scent. My daughter was turned off by the scent at first, but then she said it was good. It's soft and chewy, not rubbery. It doesn't stick to the teeth too badly, and it's not overly sweet. It's really not bad at all. I like it better than traditional red licorice and a thousand times better than black licorice. I'm very picky about my candy, though. I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",3

For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee ""regular and black"" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.",5

164,513084,"I made the mistake of eating this cereal before reading the ingredient label.  You would think with Sugar, Corn Syrup, Brown Sugar, Honey, Barley Malt Extract, and Malt Syrup it would be sweet enough.  But no, they also added Sucralose, which explains the gross aftertaste.  If you dislike artificial sweeteners, skip this cereal.  I prefer getting fiber from cereals with short lists of ingredients, with mostly things I actually can identify.",1

167,521332,"Believe it or not, I've never tried British steamed pudding until now. I ordered Aunty's Chocolate and Spotted Dick puddings on Amazon after the recent Royal Wedding of William and Kate. I noticed on Amazon that a lot of people were buying things such as scone mixes, lemon curd, clotted cream, British tea, etc. I also noticed that some people bought steamed pudding as well. I've  always wanted to try British steamed pudding after I read Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" as a child, and saw ""A Christmas Carol"", the 1999 movie with Patrick Stewart and Richard E. Grant. I've seen many movie versions of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", and I honestly think that the Patrick Stewart version is the best one. The mother of an ex-boyfriend of mine told me that she saw Patrick Stewart doing the one-man Broadway show of ""A Christmas Carol"" when he came to St. Louis, and she told me that Patrick Stewart was excellent. Anyways, the 1999 ""A Christmas Carol"" movie captured the Cratchit family Christmas dinner so well. And the scene where Mrs. Cratchit brings in the Christmas pudding/plum pudding was a nice scene, and made me want to try Christmas pudding. Even though this is not titled Christmas pudding/plum pudding, it's close enough. I popped these puddings in the microwave and served them to my mother as part of her Mother's Day gift, and my whole family liked both Aunty's steamed puddings. I prefer the chocolate pudding over the spotted dick pudding. I bought some extra chocolate steamed puddings for some of my co-workers to try. I've also decided to order Walkers Shortbread Rich Fruit Pudding on Amazon to get the actual Christmas pudding experience. David Perdue has an excellent Charles Dickens website - type ""charlesdickenspage.com"" as part of the URL. Click on ""Dickens and Christmas"", scroll down and to the left there is an actual plum pudding recipe for people who desire to take the time to cook the pudding a la Cratchit family. Anyways, these Aunty's steamed puddings are easy to cook - pop them in the microwave for 30 to 40 seconds.  And they're less than 5% fat, and are suitable for vegetarians as well. If you want to try something different, then try Aunty's steamed puddings!",5
168,521893,"While in university, I used to visit friends at a farm where they made jam from scratch, baked their breads and hunted for meat. Our friend Gladis was an excellent cook, and had a spread for us on weekends.

The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box.  The potatoes do remain firm though.  It's hard to describe the flavor.  Creamy yet artificial tasting.

I tried with all my might to get through a fourth of the cup but I simply could not do it. This so-called cappuccino tasted greasy and overly sweet at the same time. I did not even know that was possible for a caffeine product. I would have rather had gas station cappuccino than this garbage.

I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.,4
