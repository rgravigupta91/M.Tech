It's been two hours since I've eaten and I'm still unable to feel okay after having water, tea and rest.

I asked if the only way to get those happy meals was to buy meat option meals that we don't eat and then keep the toy, and was told politely that yes, that's exactly what I needed to do if I wanted them toys.

To be fair, apart from a few instances like this, the experiences have been alright thus far over the years. But someone needs to look in to the little stuff like this, because it's not like people come only for the food, noh?
